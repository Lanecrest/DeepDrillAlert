# Deep Drill Alert
Creates an alert if there are any forbidden deep drills on the map. Since deep drills are automatically marked as forbidden once the area they are drilling is depleted, this will alert you without needing to manually check on your drilling locations.

# ChangeLog
## 0.2.0 [08/24/24]
- Updated mod to allow localization.
- Included my own German and Spanish (both Latin American and Castilian as I believe the language would be the same) localizations
- Created GitHub project with MIT License.

## 0.1.0 [08/24/24]
- Initial creation, hardcoded alert language for forbidden deep drills.

## Bugs
- If there is anything incorrect about the German and Spanish localizations please feel free to post an issue or do a pull request or reach out to me otherwise if you know how.
- Feel free to offer localizations for other languages via the same methods as well.

## ToDo
- Maybe add support for specialized drills like for vanilla expanded chemfuel and other modded resources, etc
