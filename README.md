# Deep Drill Alert
Creates an alert if there are any forbidden deep drills on the map. Since deep drills are automatically marked as forbidden once the area they are drilling is depleted, this will alert you that that a drill has become forbidden, implying that all the resources in that area have been drilled.

# FAQ
- Is this compatible with {mod name}?
  - This mod does one very specific thing so it should be compatibile with virtually anything. The only conflicts that would maybe occur would be using it with another mod that triggers an alert based on deep drills being marked as forbidden, and even then, you would probably just have duplicate alerts and not any real errors.
- Why did you make this mod?
  - Because I couldn't find anything in the workshop that did this. Maybe something is there, but all I found were mods that add a bunch of new features or make a lot of changes around ground scanning and deep drilling, and more power to the people who want those features, but I wanted something that didn't make any changes to the vanilla system, other than tell me when a deep drill was done drilling.
- Can you make it so this makes an alert when a drill is destroyed or loses power?
  - No. That isn't really the point of this mod. The point of this mod is to let you know when a deep drill is done drilling and that is it.
- The alert also triggers when I manually mark a drill as forbidden, not just when it automatically becomes forbidden.
  - Yeah, and I wouldn't call this a bug either. I'm not sure the game knows how to tell the difference between the player manually marking a structure as forbidden and it becoming forbidden automatically due to a game state.
- Can you add [insert localization]?
  - I would love to if someone wants to supply it! This mod support localizations through XML files. I created German and Spanish ones myself as I have studied both of those languages so I felt confident doing them, however if you do notice any grammatical errors with those (or other localizations if they are ever added), be sure to let me know so I can corret them!
